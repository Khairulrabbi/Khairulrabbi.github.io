      <p>Software clones are often a result of copying and pasting as an act of ad-hoc reuse by programmers, and can occur at many levels, from simple statement sequences to blocks, methods, classes, source files, subsystems, models, architectures and entire designs, and in all software artifacts (code, models, requirements or architecture documentation, etc.). Software clone research is of high relevance for software engineering research and practice today.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>A partial list of the topics is as follows (this list is by no means exhaustive, and it is a goal of the workshop to further extend it):
        <ul>
          <li>Use cases for clones and clone management in the software lifecycle</li>
          <li>Experiences with clones and clone management in practice</li>
          <li>Types and nature of clones in software systems</li>
          <li>Causes and effects of clones</li>
          <li>Techniques and algorithms for clone detection, search, analysis, and management</li>
          <li>Clone and clone pattern visualization</li>
          <li>Tools and systems for detecting software clones</li>
          <li>Applications of clone detection and analysis</li>
          <li>System architecture and clones</li>
          <li>Effect of clones to system complexity and quality</li>
          <li>Clone analysis in families of similar systems</li>
          <li>Measures of code similarity</li>
          <li>Economic and trade-off models for clone removal</li>
          <li>Evaluation and benchmarking of detection methods</li>
          <li>Licensing and plagiarism issues</li>
          <li>Clone-aware software design and development</li>
          <li>Refactoring through clone analysis</li>
          <li>Higher-level clones in models and designs</li>
          <li>Clone evolution and variation</li>
          <li>Role of clones in software system evolution</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
      	Sider is a Tokyo-based software company committed to the improvement of the software development process. They are a spinoff of a public software services company, Fixstars Corporation. Sider serves over 15,000 developers in 30+ countries with an automated code review tool (Sider Review), and also provides a team management tool (Sider Team Insights) that aggregates developer progress data in a non-invasive way to improve team productivity.
	<br/><br/>
	Their latest tool, Sider Scan, is an advanced code clone detection tool that finds and monitors bugs caused by code clones with superior speed, high flexibility, and a practical user interface. It has raised the standard of code clone detection, and can automatically find bugs, and suggest how to fix them. Examples of bugs detected can be found at their website. Sider Scan is available for local devices as well as for servers. It can be downloaded free at <a href="https://siderlabs.com/scan/">siderlabs.com/scan/</a>.
