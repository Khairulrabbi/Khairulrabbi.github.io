    <p>Software clones are often a result of copying and pasting as an act of ad-hoc reuse by programmers. This was
      often seen at the project-level, however, due to emerging technology stacks, developers and researchers are paying
      attention to the ecosystem-level. Hence, the software cloning community is extending target topics to include
      various types of software clones at the ecosystem level, with examples such as project cloning, clones in
      ecosystems, project similarity and so on.</p>
    <p>Clones are not limited to only source code, and can occur at the software system (from simple statement sequences
      to blocks, methods, classes, source files, subsystems, models, architectures, etc) to the entire software
      ecosystem (inter-dependent software systems, libraries), and occur in all software artifacts (source code,
      binaries, configuration build files, models, requirements or architecture documentation, etc ). Software clone
      research is of high relevance for software engineering research and practice today.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>A partial list of the topics is as follows (this list is by no means exhaustive, and it is a goal of the workshop
      to further extend it):
    <ul>
      <li>Cloning at the ecosystem-level</li>
      <li>Role of clones in software system evolution</li>
      <li>Techniques and algorithms for clone detection, search, analysis, and management</li>
      <li>Tools and systems for detecting software clones</li>
      <li>Applications of clone detection and analysis</li>
      <li>Use cases for clones and clone management in the software lifecycle</li>
      <li>Experiences with clones and clone management in practice</li>
      <li>Types and nature of clones in software systems</li>
      <li>Clone evolution and variation</li>
      <li>Causes and effects of clones</li>
      <li>Clone and clone pattern visualization</li>
      <li>System architecture and clones</li>
      <li>Effect of clones to system complexity and quality</li>
      <li>Clone analysis in families of similar systems</li>
      <li>Measures of clone similarity</li>
      <li>Economic and trade-off models for clone removal</li>
      <li>Evaluation and benchmarking of detection methods</li>
      <li>Licensing and plagiarism issues</li>
      <li>Clone-aware software design and development</li>
      <li>Refactoring through clone analysis</li>
      <li>Higher-level clones in models and designs</li>
    </ul>
