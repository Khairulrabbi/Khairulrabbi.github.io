      <h3>Large scale clone detection, analysis and benchmarking: an evolutionary perspective</h3>
    </div>--->
In this presentation, we review empirical research in software
clone management: how widespread the collection of empirical evidence
related to software clones is in our community, what kind of empirical
methods have been used so far, and what we could do better regarding
empirical evaluations of our claims, methods, and tools. This
presentation comes with a disclaimer: the presenter does not have all
the answers; the presenter's goal is rather to raise awareness and to
provide points to ponder on this important subject.
