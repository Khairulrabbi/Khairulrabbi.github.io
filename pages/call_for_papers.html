  <h2>16th International Workshop on Software Clones (IWSC 2022)</h2>
  <h3>Co-located with <a href="https://cyprusconferences.org/icsme2022/" target="_blank">the 38th IEEE International
      Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME 2022)</a></h3>
  <h3>October 2nd, 2022, Limassol, Cyprus</h3>

  <p>Software clones are often a result of copying and pasting as an act of ad-hoc reuse by programmers. This was often
    seen at the project-level, however, due to emerging technology stacks, developers and researchers are paying
    attention to the ecosystem-level. Hence, the software cloning community is extending target topics to include
    various types of software clones at the ecosystem level, with examples such as project cloning, clones in
    ecosystems, project similarity and so on.</p>

  <p>Clones are not limited to only source code, and can occur at the software system (from simple statement sequences
    to blocks, methods, classes, source files, subsystems, models, architectures, etc) to the entire software ecosystem
    (inter-dependent software systems, libraries), and occur in all software artifacts (source code, binaries,
    configuration build files, models, requirements or architecture documentation, etc ). Software clone research is of
    high relevance for software engineering research and practice today.</p>

  <p>
    IWSC series of events has provided a common forum for this important
    research area as it continues to grow in application breadth and
    technical depth. IWSC aims to bring researchers and practitioners to
    evaluate the current state of research, discuss common problems and
    emerging directions. Also, we are interested in discussing and spreading
    practical applications of clone technologies.
    Further details about IWSC 2022
    are here on this website (<a href="https://iwsc2022.github.io" target="_blank">https://iwsc2022.github.io</a>).
  </p>

      important viewpoints of the field. These papers must not exceed <b>7 pages including figures, appendices, and
        references</b>.

    <li>Position papers should raise new ideas and issues or describe early research achievements, emphasizing
      originality and potential to stimulate active discussion at the workshop. These papers can be of maximum <b>2
        pages including figures, appendices, and references.</b>

    <li>Tool demonstration papers (4 pages maximum) should describe clone-related tools and their applications. Tool
      papers must not exceed <b>4 pages including figures, appendices, and references.</b>
  </ul>
